# ✅ Row Level Security Implementation Complete

## Summary

I've implemented comprehensive Row Level Security (RLS) for your Futureproof Feedback platform. This provides defense-in-depth security for your Supabase database and storage bucket.

## What Was Created

### 1. Database RLS Policies ✅
**File**: `prisma/migrations/20251005_add_rls_policies/migration.sql`

- **23 RLS policies** across 6 tables
- All tables have RLS enabled
- Policies cover SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations

### 2. Storage Bucket Policies ✅
**File**: `prisma/migrations/storage_policies.sql`

- 4 policies for the `audio-tracks` bucket
- Public read, authenticated upload, owner-only modify/delete

### 3. Setup Script ✅
**File**: `scripts/setup-rls.sh`

- Automated RLS deployment script
- Includes verification queries
- Makes deployment simple and repeatable

### 4. Documentation ✅

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `SECURITY_SETUP.md` | Complete security configuration guide |
| `RLS_IMPLEMENTATION.md` | Implementation summary and checklist |
| `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` | This quick reference document |
| `README.md` | Updated with security information |

## Quick Start

### Apply RLS Policies

```bash
# 1. Set your database URL
export DATABASE_URL="your-supabase-connection-string"

# 2. Run the setup script
./scripts/setup-rls.sh

# 3. Apply storage policies in Supabase SQL Editor
# Copy and run: prisma/migrations/storage_policies.sql
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
# Check that RLS is enabled
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "
SELECT tablename, 
  CASE WHEN rowsecurity THEN '✅' ELSE '❌' END 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public';"
```

## Important Understanding

### Current Architecture

Your app currently uses:
- ✅ LearnWorlds username-based auth
- ✅ Service role key for all operations
- ✅ API-layer authorization

This means **RLS is currently bypassed** for API operations.

### What RLS Protects Now

RLS policies protect against:
- ✅ Direct database access (Supabase Dashboard, SQL clients)
- ✅ Third-party tools connecting to your database
- ✅ Accidental exposure of anon key
- ✅ Future API changes
- ✅ Security audits and compliance requirements

### Security Model

```
Current (RLS Bypassed):
  LearnWorlds → Username → API (service role) → Database ✋ RLS bypassed

With Proper Auth (RLS Active):
  LearnWorlds → Username → API (anon + JWT) → Database ✅ RLS enforced
```

## Policy Details

### Users Table (3 policies)
- Anyone can view profiles
- Users can create their own profile
- Users can update their own profile

### Posts Table (4 policies)
- Anyone can view posts
- Authenticated users can create posts (author_user_id must match auth.uid())
- Users can update their own posts
- Users can delete their own posts

### Comments Table (4 policies)
- Anyone can view comments
- Authenticated users can create comments (author_user_id must match auth.uid())
- Users can update their own comments
- Users can delete their own comments

### Vote Tables (4 policies each)
- Anyone can view votes (needed for score calculation)
- Users can create their own votes (user_id must match auth.uid())
- Users can update their own votes
- Users can delete their own votes

### Notifications Table (4 policies)
- Users can ONLY see their own notifications (user_id must match auth.uid())
- Authenticated users can create notifications
- Users can update their own notifications (e.g., mark as read)
- Users can delete their own notifications

### Storage Bucket (4 policies)
- Public read access (anyone can download via signed URLs)
- Authenticated upload only
- Owner can update their own files
- Owner can delete their own files

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Apply the policies** (see Quick Start above)
2. **Verify** the installation worked
3. **Test** your application still works correctly
4. **Review** the detailed documentation in `SECURITY_SETUP.md`

### Future Improvements

To make RLS actively enforce in your API:

1. Migrate from service role to proper Supabase Auth
2. Generate JWTs for LearnWorlds users
3. Use anon key + JWT in API operations
4. Let RLS automatically enforce authorization

See `SECURITY_SETUP.md` → "Migrating to Proper Auth" for implementation details.

## Testing

### Verify RLS is Active

```sql
-- Should return all tables with RLS enabled
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public';
```

### Test Policy Enforcement

Try accessing data directly in Supabase Dashboard:
1. Go to Table Editor
2. Try to view notifications → You should see none (requires auth.uid())
3. Try to insert a post → Should be restricted
4. Try to delete someone else's post → Should fail

### Check Policy Count

```sql
-- Should return policy counts for each table
SELECT tablename, COUNT(*) as policies
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
GROUP BY tablename;
```

Expected:
- users: 3 policies
- posts: 4 policies
- comments: 4 policies
- post_votes: 4 policies
- comment_votes: 4 policies
- notifications: 4 policies

## Rollback (If Needed)

To disable RLS:

```sql
ALTER TABLE users DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE posts DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE post_votes DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE comments DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE comment_votes DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE notifications DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```
