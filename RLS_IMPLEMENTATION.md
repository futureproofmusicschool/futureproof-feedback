# Row Level Security Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

### ✅ Database RLS Policies

**Location**: `prisma/migrations/20251005_add_rls_policies/migration.sql`

All tables now have Row Level Security enabled with comprehensive policies:

| Table | Policies | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `users` | 3 policies | Public read, self create/update |
| `posts` | 4 policies | Public read, authenticated create, author-only update/delete |
| `comments` | 4 policies | Public read, authenticated create, author-only update/delete |
| `post_votes` | 4 policies | Public read, user-only manage own votes |
| `comment_votes` | 4 policies | Public read, user-only manage own votes |
| `notifications` | 4 policies | User-only view/manage own notifications |

**Total**: 23 RLS policies across 6 tables

### ✅ Storage Bucket Policies

**Location**: `prisma/migrations/storage_policies.sql`

Audio storage bucket (`audio-tracks`) secured with:
- Public read access (for signed URLs)
- Authenticated upload only
- Owner-only update/delete

### ✅ Documentation

- **`SECURITY_SETUP.md`**: Complete security configuration guide
- **`RLS_IMPLEMENTATION.md`**: This summary document
- **`README.md`**: Updated with security information
- **`scripts/setup-rls.sh`**: Automated setup script

## How to Apply

### Option 1: Automated Script (Recommended)

```bash
# Set your database URL
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:password@db.xxx.supabase.co:5432/postgres"

# Run the setup script
./scripts/setup-rls.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Application

#### Database Policies

```bash
# Using psql
psql $DATABASE_URL -f prisma/migrations/20251005_add_rls_policies/migration.sql

# Or using Prisma
npx prisma db execute --file prisma/migrations/20251005_add_rls_policies/migration.sql
```

#### Storage Policies

1. Open Supabase SQL Editor: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/sql
2. Copy contents of `prisma/migrations/storage_policies.sql`
3. Paste and execute

## Verification

### Check RLS Status

```sql
-- View RLS enabled status for all tables
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename, 
    CASE WHEN rowsecurity THEN '✅ Enabled' ELSE '❌ Disabled' END as rls_status
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
ORDER BY tablename;
```

Expected output:
```
 schemaname |   tablename    | rls_status  
------------+----------------+-------------
 public     | comments       | ✅ Enabled
 public     | comment_votes  | ✅ Enabled
 public     | notifications  | ✅ Enabled
 public     | posts          | ✅ Enabled
 public     | post_votes     | ✅ Enabled
 public     | users          | ✅ Enabled
```

### Check Policies

```sql
-- Count policies per table
SELECT 
    tablename,
    COUNT(*) as policy_count
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
GROUP BY tablename
ORDER BY tablename;
```

Expected output:
```
   tablename    | policy_count 
----------------+--------------
 comments       |            4
 comment_votes  |            4
 notifications  |            4
 posts          |            4
 post_votes     |            4
 users          |            3
```

### Check Storage Policies

```sql
-- View storage bucket policies
SELECT 
    policyname,
    cmd
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'storage' 
  AND tablename = 'objects'
  AND policyname LIKE '%audio%'
ORDER BY policyname;
```

Expected: 4 policies for audio-tracks bucket

## Important Notes

### Current Behavior

⚠️ **RLS policies are NOT actively enforced in API operations** because the app uses service role key (which bypasses RLS).

RLS currently protects:
- Direct database access (Supabase Dashboard, SQL clients)
- Third-party tools
- Future API changes

### To Enable Active RLS Enforcement

You need to migrate from service role to proper auth:

1. **Update `lib/supabase.ts`**:
   ```typescript
   // Instead of always using service role
   export function createUserClient(accessToken: string) {
     return createClient(
       process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
       process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!, // Use anon key
       {
         global: {
           headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}` }
         }
       }
     );
   }
   ```

2. **Update API middleware** to generate proper Supabase Auth tokens

3. **Use user-specific client** in API routes instead of `supabaseAdmin`

See `SECURITY_SETUP.md` → "Migrating to Proper Auth" for details.

## Testing

### Test in Supabase Dashboard

1. Go to Table Editor
2. Try to insert/update/delete rows
3. You should be restricted based on RLS policies

### Test via SQL

```sql
-- Test as anonymous user (should be restricted)
SET ROLE anon;
SELECT * FROM notifications; -- Should return 0 rows (needs auth)
RESET ROLE;

-- Test RLS is enabled
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
  AND rowsecurity = false;
-- Should return 0 rows (all tables have RLS enabled)
```

### Test Storage Policies

1. Try uploading to `audio-tracks` bucket without authentication → Should fail
2. Try uploading with valid JWT → Should succeed
3. Try deleting someone else's file → Should fail

## Security Checklist

- [x] RLS enabled on all tables
- [x] Policies created for SELECT operations
- [x] Policies created for INSERT operations
- [x] Policies created for UPDATE operations
- [x] Policies created for DELETE operations
- [x] Storage bucket policies applied
- [x] Documentation created
- [x] Setup scripts provided
- [x] Verification queries documented

## Next Steps

1. **Apply the policies** using the instructions above
2. **Verify** using the SQL queries provided
3. **Review** `SECURITY_SETUP.md` for advanced configuration
4. **Consider** migrating to proper Supabase Auth for active RLS enforcement
5. **Test** your application to ensure it still works as expected

## Rollback

If you need to remove the RLS policies:

```sql
-- Disable RLS on all tables
ALTER TABLE users DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE posts DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE post_votes DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE comments DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE comment_votes DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE notifications DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop all policies (optional)
-- This is automatic when you disable RLS, but can be done explicitly:
-- DROP POLICY "<policy_name>" ON <table_name>;
```

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check `SECURITY_SETUP.md` for detailed explanations
2. Review [Supabase RLS Documentation](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres/row-level-security)
3. Check [PostgreSQL RLS Docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-rowsecurity.html)

## Performance

RLS policies are optimized with:
- ✅ Indexes on all policy-checked columns
- ✅ Efficient `auth.uid()` usage patterns
- ✅ Minimal joins in policy expressions
- ✅ Role-specific policies (authenticated vs anon)

Monitor query performance after deployment and adjust as needed.
